# <Project name> — build ledger

Statuses: `todo → doing → done`, plus `blocked` (waiting on a human or an
external gate — the stage becomes a runbook) and `skipped` (decided against,
one-line reason). Partial completion is a normal, resumable state.

Keep table rows to **ONE line** — detail goes in the notes block below, never
in a table cell. Sessions read the status table plus only the notes blocks of
the stages they `depend` on (the final review stage reads all of it). Update
your stage's row and notes block at the end of every session (Operating
protocol, finish protocol).

## Status

| Stage | Status | Verified | Date | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S0 <stage name> | todo | — | — | — |
| S1 <stage name> | todo | — | — | — |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| SF Plan review | todo | — | — | — |

## Notes

As-built notes, acceptance evidence, gotchas, handoff notes, follow-ups. One
block per stage; sessions read only the blocks of their `depends` stages.

<!-- One ### S<N> block per stage. Templates for the states you'll hit:

  done      — paste the real acceptance output, then the as-built summary and
              any gotchas the next stage needs to know.
  doing     — tick the completed Steps checkboxes in the stage file; write a
              handoff note here (what's left, where to resume).
  blocked   — record exactly what human/external action unblocks it, as a
              runbook the human can follow; no faked progress.
  skipped   — one-line reason.
  follow-up — a shortcut or scope-creep item spotted here that became (or
              should become) its own stage; name it so the review stage sees it.
